# OpenAI Integration for Contract Webapp

This document explains how the webapp has been updated to use OpenAI API for all AI features.

## Overview

The webapp has been migrated from using a Python backend with local LLM to using OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini model for all AI-powered features. This provides:

- Better performance and reliability
- More consistent and professional responses
- Access to OpenAI's latest language models
- Simplified deployment (no need for Python backend)

## Environment Variables Required

Add the following to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
# OpenAI Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Other existing environment variables...
```

## Updated AI Features

All the following features now use OpenAI GPT-4o-mini:

### 1. Chat Interface (`/api/ai/chat`)
- Contract-related conversations
- Legal document assistance
- Template generation requests

### 2. Contract Generation (`/api/contracts/generate`)
- Service Agreements
- Employment Contracts
- Non-Disclosure Agreements
- Software License Agreements
- Consulting Agreements
- Partnership Agreements

### 3. Contract Analysis (`/api/contracts/analyze-document`)
- Comprehensive legal document analysis
- Risk assessment
- Compliance checking
- Improvement recommendations

### 4. Contract Improvement (`/api/contracts/improve`)
- General contract enhancements
- Specific improvement types
- Legal best practices implementation

### 5. Contract Recommendations (`/api/contracts/get-recommendations`)
- Industry-specific recommendations
- Risk mitigation suggestions
- Best practices guidance

### 6. Text Explanation (`/api/contracts/explain-text`)
- Legal term explanations
- Contract clause clarification
- Plain language translations

### 7. Quick Contract Editing (`/api/contracts/quick-edit`)
- Party name changes
- Amount updates
- Date modifications
- Location changes
- Custom edits

### 8. Review Checklists (`/api/contracts/review-checklist`)
- Comprehensive contract review checklists
- Compliance verification
- Missing elements identification

## Technical Implementation

### OpenAI Configuration (`lib/openai.ts`)

The main OpenAI integration is handled through a centralized configuration file that provides:

- OpenAI client initialization
- Helper functions for different AI tasks
- Consistent error handling
- Model selection (default: gpt-4o-mini)

### Key Functions

- `generateText()` - General text generation
- `analyzeContract()` - Contract analysis
- `generateContract()` - Contract generation
- `generateChatResponse()` - Chat responses
- `improveContract()` - Contract improvements
- `getContractRecommendations()` - Recommendations
- `explainText()` - Text explanations

## Model Configuration

- **Model**: GPT-4o-mini (default)
- **Max Tokens**: 4000-8000 depending on task
- **Temperature**: 0.7 (balanced creativity and consistency)
- **System Prompt**: Specialized for legal contract assistance

## Error Handling

All OpenAI API calls include proper error handling for:
- Invalid API keys
- Rate limiting
- Quota exceeded
- Network issues
- Model-specific errors

## Migration Benefits

1. **Reliability**: OpenAI's infrastructure is more reliable than local LLM
2. **Performance**: Faster response times
3. **Quality**: More consistent and professional responses
4. **Maintenance**: No need to maintain Python backend
5. **Scalability**: OpenAI handles scaling automatically

## Cost Considerations

- GPT-4o-mini is cost-effective for most use cases
- Monitor usage through OpenAI dashboard
- Consider implementing usage limits if needed

## Security

- API keys are stored in environment variables
- No sensitive data is sent to OpenAI beyond what's necessary
- All responses are generated locally in the application

## Getting Started

1. Get an OpenAI API key from https://platform.openai.com/
2. Add the API key to your `.env.local` file
3. Restart your development server
4. Test the AI features to ensure they're working

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Failed to generate contract"** - Check your OpenAI API key
2. **"Rate limit exceeded"** - Wait a moment and try again
3. **"Quota exceeded"** - Check your OpenAI account usage

### Debug Mode

Set `NODE_ENV=development` to see detailed error messages in the console.

## Future Enhancements

- Support for different OpenAI models based on task complexity
- Caching for frequently requested responses
- Usage analytics and monitoring
- Custom fine-tuned models for specific contract types
